DivSugar
========

DivSugar is **a CSS-based 3D graphics library**, which provides a 3D scene graph, an animation support system, and utility geometry classes. Each node of the scene graph is an extended div element, so it is very easy to integrate 3D animations into existing web pages.

DivSugar depends on CSS 3D transform and runs on Safari, Chrome, and Firefox for now.

Getting Started
---------------
First, include **divsugar.min.js** file or **divsugar.js** file. The former is for normal use and the latter is debug use.
```html
<script src="divsugar.min.js"></script>
```
Then you can use all of the functions with DivSugar namespace.
