DivSugar
========

DivSugar is a CSS-based 3D graphics library, which provides a 3D scene graph, an animation support system, and utility geometry classes.

Each element of the scene graph is an extended div element, so it is very easy to integrate 3D animations into existing web pages.

DivSugar depends on CSS 3D transform and runs on Safari, Chrome, and Firefox for now.
